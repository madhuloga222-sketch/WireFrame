        <!--DESCRIPTION-->
        <div class="borded">
        <strong id="img1">Description:-</strong>
        <p class="sizer">An inductor is a passive electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. Essentially, it's a coil of wire, and its key property is inductance, which opposes any change in the current flowing through it. This opposition is due to the magnetic field generated by the current, which induces a voltage that counteracts the change in current.</p>
        <h3>1.Basic Structure:-</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="sizer">An inductor is typically a coil of wire, often wrapped around a core made of ferrite or iron, to enhance its magnetic field.The basic structure of an inductor consists of a coil of conducting wire, usually made of copper, wound around a core. The core may be made of air, iron, or ferrite, depending on the application.</li>
            <li class="sizer">The number of turns of the coil, the type of core, and the coil’s dimensions all determine the inductance value of the component. In simple terms, the inductor’s structure is designed to maximize its ability to store energy in the form of a magnetic field and oppose sudden changes in current.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.Function:-</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="sizer">Inductors resist changes in current. When the current increases, the inductor generates a back EMF (electromotive force) to oppose the increase.Function of an inductor is to store energy in the form of a magnetic field and to resist sudden changes in current flowing through a circuit. </li>
            <li class="sizer">This behavior makes inductors useful for filtering, smoothing out voltage spikes, and energy storage.This property makes inductors very useful in maintaining smooth current flow, filtering signals, and protecting circuits from spikes or surges.</li>
            <li class="sizer">In practical applications, inductors are used for filtering in power supplies, tuning in communication circuits, energy storage in converters, and noise suppression in electronic devices.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3.Key Properties:</h2>
        <h3>Inductance (L):</h3>
        <p class="sizer">Measured in Henrys (H), inductance quantifies the inductor's ability to store magnetic energy. A higher inductance means the inductor can store more energy and resist current changes more effectively.Inductance is the property of an inductor that describes its ability to oppose changes in current by generating a voltage across its terminals.</p>
        <h3>Impedance (Z):</h3>
        <p class="sizer">Inductors also exhibit impedance, which is the opposition to the flow of alternating current (AC). Impedance increases with frequency.Impedance (Z) is the total opposition that a circuit presents to the flow of alternating current (AC). It is a combination of resistance (R), which opposes current flow without depending on frequency, and reactance (X), which is caused by inductors and capacitors and varies with frequency.</p>

        <strong id="img3">1.Choke-Inductor:</strong>
        <div class="image">
            <div class="imaged">
                <img src="./Assests/choke-inductor.jpg 34.jpg" alt="choke" width="290" height="290"> 
            </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="sizer">A choke inductor, commonly called a choke, is a type of inductor specifically designed to block or “choke” high-frequency alternating current (AC) while allowing direct current (DC) or low-frequency signals to pass through.</li>
            <li class="sizer">Structurally, a choke consists of a coil of wire wound around a core, which may be air, iron, or ferrite. Depending on the design, chokes can be classified into audio-frequency (AF) chokes, which operate at lower frequencies, and radio-frequency (RF) chokes, which are optimized to block very high-frequency signals.</li>
            <li class="sizer">In practical applications, chokes are used in DC power supplies to smoothen current, in communication systems to eliminate interference, in fluorescent lamps, and in filters for electronic devices.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong id="img4">2.Air-Core-Inductor:</strong>
         <div class="imaged">
                <img src="./Assests/air-core-inductor 23.webp" alt="air-core" width="290" height="290"> 
            </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="sizer">An air-core inductor is a type of inductor that uses air as the core material instead of magnetic materials like iron or ferrite. It is made by winding a coil of insulated copper wire in a cylindrical, toroidal, or spiral shape, with no solid core inside—only air or a non-magnetic material such as plastic.</li>
            <li class="sizer">Since air has a very low magnetic permeability, the inductance of an air-core inductor is generally lower compared to iron-core or ferrite-core inductors.</li>
            <li class="sizer">The main advantage of air-core inductors is that they are free from core losses such as hysteresis and eddy current losses, which makes them highly efficient at high frequencies.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong id="img5">3.Iron-Core-Inductors:</strong>
         <div class="imaged">
                <img src="./Assests/iron-core-inductors.jpg 34.jpg" alt="iron-core" width="290" height="290"> 
            </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="sizer">An iron-core inductor is a type of inductor that uses iron or laminated iron sheets as the core material to increase its inductance. Since iron has much higher magnetic permeability than air, the magnetic field produced by the coil is greatly concentrated, which results in higher inductance values even with fewer turns of wire.</li>
            <li class="sizer">This makes iron-core inductors more compact and efficient for handling large currents and low-frequency applications.</li>
            <li class="sizer">The key advantage of iron-core inductors is their high inductance and current-handling capacity, making them suitable for power supplies, audio equipment, transformers, and filtering applications in AC circuits.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong id="img6">4.Ferrite-Core-Inductor:</strong>
         <div class="imaged">
                <img src="./Assests/ferrite-core-inductor.png 23.jpg" alt="ferrite" width="290" height="290"> 
            </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="sizer">Because of these properties, ferrite-core inductors are especially efficient at high-frequency applications, where iron-core inductors would suffer from excessive losses.</li>
            <li class="sizer">Ferrite-core inductors are widely used in switching power supplies, radio frequency (RF) circuits, filters, transformers, and noise suppression devices.</li>
            <li class="sizer">They provide high inductance in a compact size and perform well in reducing electromagnetic interference (EMI). Different types of ferrites (soft ferrite materials like MnZn and NiZn) are chosen depending on the frequency range.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong id="img7">5.Fixed-Inductor:</strong>
         <div class="imaged">
                <img src="./Assests/fixed inductor.jpg 45.webp" alt="fixed" width="290" height="290"> 
            </div
        <ul>
            <li class="sizer">Since the inductance is fixed, these inductors are simple, reliable, and widely used in electronic circuits where a stable inductance value is required.</li>
            <li class="sizer">Fixed inductors are available in different shapes and sizes, such as axial leaded inductors (like resistors), radial leaded types, and surface-mount device (SMD) inductors.</li>
            <li class="sizer">They are commonly used in filters, power supplies, oscillators, radio-frequency (RF) circuits, energy storage, and signal processing. Because of their simplicity and durability, fixed inductors are one of the most commonly used inductors in both analog and digital electronics.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong id="img8">6.Variable-Inductor:</strong>
         <div class="imaged">
                <img src="./Assests/Variable inductor.jpg 56.jpg" alt="variable" width="290" height="290"> 
            </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="sizer">By sliding the core in or out, the magnetic field concentration changes, which in turn increases or decreases the inductance value.</li>
            <li class="sizer">Variable inductors are commonly used in radio-frequency (RF) circuits, oscillators, tuning circuits, filters, and communication systems, where precise adjustment of inductance is necessary for matching frequencies or fine-tuning signals.</li>
            <li class="sizer">Unlike fixed inductors, they provide flexibility and control, but they are usually larger, more complex, and costlier.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong id="img9">7.RF-Inductors:</strong>
         <div class="imaged">
                <img src="./Assests/RF-inductors.jpg 76.jpg" alt="rf" width="290" height="290"> 
            </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="sizer">An RF inductor (Radio Frequency inductor) is a special type of inductor designed to operate effectively at high frequencies, typically in the kHz, MHz, or GHz range used in communication systems.</li>
            <li class="sizer">They are usually made with air cores or ferrite cores, depending on the application, and often come in compact forms such as surface-mount (SMD) inductors, chip inductors, or wire-wound types.The main function of an RF inductor is to tune, filter, and match impedance in circuits where radio signals are processed.</li>
            <li class="sizer">They are commonly used in radio receivers and transmitters, oscillators, antennas, RF amplifiers, and communication devices like smartphones, Wi-Fi modules, and Bluetooth systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong id="img10">8.Power-Inductor</strong>
         <div class="imaged">
                <img src="./Assests/power-inductor.webp 98.jpg" alt="power" width="290" height="290"> 
            </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="sizer">A power inductor is a type of inductor specifically designed to handle high currents and power levels while maintaining stable inductance. Unlike RF inductors, which are optimized for high-frequency signal tuning, power inductors are built to store energy efficiently in their magnetic field and deliver it when needed, making them essential in power management circuits.</li>
            <li class="sizer">They are usually constructed with ferrite or powdered iron cores to achieve high inductance in a compact size while minimizing core losses.Power inductors are widely used in switching power supplies, DC-DC converters, voltage regulators, inverters, and motor control circuits, where they help smooth current flow, reduce voltage ripple, and ensure efficient energy transfer.</li>
            <li class="sizer">Their design focuses on high current handling, low resistance (DCR), and thermal stability, which allows them to operate reliably under heavy loads.In short, a power inductor acts as an energy storage and filtering component in power electronics, making it a vital part of modern devices such as computers, mobile phones, automotive electronics, and renewable energy systems.</li>
