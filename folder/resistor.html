        <strong id="img1">Description:-</strong>
        <p class="size">A resistor is one of the most common and important components in electronics. Its main function is to oppose or limit the flow of electric current in a circuit. By providing resistance, it helps control voltage and current levels, divide voltages, protect sensitive components, and shape signals in electronic devices. Resistors are made from materials like carbon, metal film, or wire wound, and they are available in fixed and variable types depending on the need.</p>

        <p class="size">The resistor color bands are a standard method used to indicate the resistance value, tolerance, and sometimes reliability of a resistor. Instead of printing numbers, manufacturers use colored stripes around the resistor’s body because it is small and compact. Each color corresponds to a number from 0 to 9, and by reading the bands in sequence, the exact resistance value can be determined. Usually, a resistor has four, five, or six bands.</p>

        <h3>Explanation:-</h3>
        <p class="size">Resistor values are usually identified by colored bands painted on the resistor body. Each color represents a digit or a multiplier. The bands are read from left to right, with the last band (tolerance) often spaced apart.</p>
        <p class="size">1.First Band → 1st digit of resistance value</p>
        <p class="size">2.Second Band → 2nd digit of resistance value</p>
        <p class="size">3.Third Band → Multiplier (power of 10)</p>
        <p class="size">4.Fourth Band → Tolerance (accuracy of resistor)</p>
        <p class="size">5.Fifth & Sixth Bands (if present) → Extra digit or temperature coefficient for precision resistors</p>

        <p class="size">The Old Soviet Resistor refers to the resistors manufactured in the Soviet Union during the mid-20th century, widely used in military, industrial, and consumer electronics. These resistors are often recognized by their unique cylindrical shapes, bold color codes, and durable ceramic or metal bodies. Unlike modern compact resistors, many Soviet types were built to withstand high temperatures, mechanical stress, and harsh environmental conditions, which made them reliable in aviation, communication, and defense systems.</p>
        <h2>Function:-</h2>
        <ul>    
            <h3>Current Limiting:</h3>
            <li class="size">Resistors reduce the amount of current flowing through a circuit, protecting sensitive components from damage.Current limiting is a technique used in electronic circuits to prevent excessive current from flowing through components, which could otherwise cause overheating, damage, or permanent failure.</li>
            <h3>Voltage Division:</h3>
            <li class="size">They can be used to create specific voltage drops across different parts of a circuit, ensuring components receive the correct voltage.Voltage division is a basic principle in electronics where the total voltage across a series circuit is divided among the resistors (or other components) in proportion to their resistance values.</li>
            <h3>Signal Shaping:</h3>
            <li class="size">Resistors, along with other components, help shape the waveforms of electronic signals.Signal shaping is a technique used in electronics to modify the form of a signal so that it meets the requirements of a specific application. In many cases, raw signals from sensors or circuits are weak, noisy, or distorted, so shaping is applied to improve their quality.</li>
            <h3>Heat Dissipation:</h3>
            <li class="size">Resistors can dissipate electrical energy as heat, which is useful in applications like heating elements.Heat dissipation is the process of releasing unwanted heat generated by electronic components and circuits during their operation. Whenever current flows through resistors, transistors, ICs, or power devices, part of the electrical energy is converted into heat due to resistance and inefficiency. </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li class="size"><h3 id="img8">Fixed Resistors:</h3>Have a specific resistance value that cannot be changed. Examples include carbon film resistors, metal film resistors, and wirewound resistors.A fixed resistor is one of the most basic and widely used electronic components designed to provide a constant resistance value in a circuit.</li>
            <li class="size"><h3 id="img9">Variable Resistors (Potentiometers):</h3> Allow for adjustment of the resistance value, often used in volume controls or sensor applications.A variable resistor is an electronic component whose resistance can be changed to control the current or voltage in a circuit.</li>
            <li class="size"><h3 id="img10">Thermistors:</h3>Resistance changes with temperature.A thermistor is a special type of resistor whose resistance changes significantly with temperature. The word “thermistor” comes from thermal and resistor.</li>
            <li class="size"><h3 id="img11">Light-Dependent Resistors (LDRs):</h3>Resistance changes with light intensity.A light-dependent resistor (LDR), also called a photoresistor, is a special type of resistor whose resistance changes with the intensity of light falling on it. In darkness, an LDR has very high resistance, often in the megaohm range, which limits current flow.</li>

        <strong>Key Characteristics:-</strong>
        <ul> 
            <li class="size"><h3>Resistance:</h3> Measured in ohms (Ω), it indicates the opposition to current flow.Resistance is the opposition offered by a material or component to the flow of electric current in a circuit. It is measured in ohms (Ω) and is governed by Ohm’s Law (V = IR), where resistance (R) is the ratio of voltage (V) across a conductor to the current (I) flowing through it.</li>
            <li class="size"><h3>Tolerance:</h3> Indicates the acceptable variation in resistance value from the stated value.Tolerance in resistors refers to the acceptable range of variation between the actual resistance value of a resistor and its labeled (nominal) value.</li>
            <li class="size"><h3>Power Rating:</h3> Specifies the maximum amount of power (heat) a resistor can dissipate without being damaged.The power rating of a resistor indicates the maximum amount of electrical power it can safely dissipate as heat without being damaged.</li>
