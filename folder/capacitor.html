        <div class="border">  
        <strong id="img1" class="sized">Description:-</strong>
        <p class="sizes">A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulator (dielectric). When voltage is applied, charge accumulates on the plates, creating an electric field. Capacitors are used for energy storage, signal filtering, and other circuit functions.</p> 
        <h2  id="img2" class="sized">Purpose:-</h2>
        <p class="sizes">Capacitors store electrical energy by accumulating electric charges on their plates. This stored energy can be released later when needed, making them useful for power delivery in various applications.Its primary purpose is to stabilize and control the flow of electricity in a circuit.</p>

        <p class="sizes">A supercapacitor, also called an ultracapacitor or electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC), is a special type of capacitor that can store a much larger amount of electrical energy compared to ordinary capacitors. Unlike batteries, which rely on chemical reactions, supercapacitors store energy through the separation of charges at the surface of electrodes and can be charged and discharged very quickly.</p>

            </div>
        <p class="sizes">A tantalum capacitor is a type of electrolytic capacitor that uses tantalum metal as one of its electrodes. It is known for having a high capacitance per volume, meaning it can store a large amount of charge in a very small size. Tantalum capacitors provide stable performance, high reliability, and excellent frequency characteristics, which makes them suitable for applications where precision and compact design are important.</p>
        <h3  id="img6" class="sized">3.Ceramic Capacitor:</h3>

            </div>
        <p class="sizes">A ceramic capacitor is one of the most common types of capacitors, made using a ceramic material as the dielectric between two metal plates. They are non-polarized, meaning they can be connected in any direction in a circuit. Ceramic capacitors are valued for their small size, low cost, high reliability, and ability to operate at high frequencies.</p>

            </div>
        <p class="sizes">A polyester capacitor is a type of film capacitor that uses polyester (PET – polyethylene terephthalate) as the dielectric material. It is one of the most commonly used film capacitors because it offers a good balance of performance, compact size, and low cost. Polyester capacitors are non-polarized, stable, and have higher capacitance per unit volume compared to some other film capacitors.</p>
        <h3  id="img8" class="sized">5.Polypropylene Capacitor:</h3>

            </div>
        <p class="sizes">A polypropylene capacitor is a high-quality type of film capacitor that uses polypropylene plastic as the dielectric. These capacitors are non-polarized and are known for their excellent electrical characteristics, such as very low dielectric losses, high insulation resistance, and exceptional stability over a wide temperature range. Because of their accuracy and reliability, polypropylene capacitors are often used in precision applications like audio systems, high-frequency circuits, medical equipment, measuring instruments, and power electronics.</p>
        <h3  id="img9" class="sized">6.Silver MICA Capacitor:</h3>

            </div>
        <p class="sizes">A Silver Mica Capacitor is a high-precision capacitor that uses mica (a natural mineral) as the dielectric, with thin silver electrodes deposited on it. These capacitors are non-polarized and are known for their outstanding stability, low losses, and high accuracy over a wide frequency and temperature range. They maintain their capacitance value very consistently, even in harsh conditions, which makes them ideal for radio frequency (RF) circuits, oscillators, filters, and high-voltage applications.</p>

            </div>
        <p class="sizes">A variable capacitor is a type of capacitor whose capacitance value can be adjusted manually or electronically as needed. Unlike fixed capacitors, which have a constant value, variable capacitors allow tuning of circuits by changing the distance between the plates or the overlapping area of the plates, often with the help of a rotating dial or screw.</p>
        <h2 class="sized"> Applications:-</h2>
