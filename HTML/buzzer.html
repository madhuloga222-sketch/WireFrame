        <!--DESCRIPTION-->
        <div class="board">
        <strong id="img1">Description:-</strong>
        <p class="font">A buzzer is an audio signaling device that produces a buzzing or beeping sound when activated. It's commonly used in various electronic devices like alarms, timers, and confirmation systems to provide an audible alert or feedback. Buzzers can be electromechanical, piezoelectric, or mechanical in nature, and they can be found in a wide range of applications, from simple toys to complex industrial equipment.</p>
        <strong>How it works:-</strong>
        <ul>
            <li class="font"><h3>Electromechanical buzzers:</h3>It contains a coil, a magnet, and a metal diaphragm. When electricity flows through the coil, it creates a magnetic field that attracts and releases the diaphragm repeatedly. This rapid vibration of the diaphragm produces sound waves, which we hear as a buzz or beep.</li>
            <li class="font"><h3>Piezoelectric buzzers:</h3>It utilize the piezoelectric effect, where a voltage applied to a ceramic material causes it to deform and vibrate, producing sound waves. </li>
            <li class="font"><h3>Mechanical buzzers:</h3>A mechanical buzzer is a type of buzzer that produces sound through mechanical vibration caused by the movement of a metal diaphragm. It operates on the principle of electromagnetism. Inside the buzzer, there is a coil and an iron armature connected to a thin metal diaphragm.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li class="font">A spring-contact buzzer is a type of mechanical buzzer that works using a spring-loaded contact mechanism to create vibrations and produce sound. It consists of an electromagnet, an armature, and a spring contact. When current flows through the coil, the electromagnet attracts the armature, breaking the circuit by pulling the spring contact away.</li>
            <li class="font">As soon as the circuit is broken, the magnetic field collapses, and the spring pushes the contact back into place, reconnecting the circuit. This process repeats rapidly, causing continuous on–off vibrations of the diaphragm, which generate a buzzing sound. </li>
            <li class="font">Spring-contact buzzers were commonly used in older telecommunication devices, alarm clocks, doorbells, and signaling systems, where a simple and effective sound output was needed.</li>
