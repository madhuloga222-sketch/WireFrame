        <!--DESCRIPTION-->

        <div class="borders">
        <strong id="img1">Description:-</strong>
        <p class="sized">A relay is an electrically operated switch that allows a low-power signal to control a high-power circuit. It acts as an intermediary, enabling a small electrical current to trigger a larger one, often used to isolate and protect different circuits or devices.relay is an electromechanical device that functions as an automatic switch, allowing a low-power electrical signal to control a higher-power circuit.</p>
        <strong id="img3">Core Function:-</strong>
        <h3>Switching Mechanism:</h3>
        <p class="sized">Relays use an electromagnet to control the movement of a switch, opening or closing a circuit based on the input signal.The switching mechanism of a relay is based on electromagnetic induction. When a small current flows through the relay’s coil, it generates a magnetic field. This magnetic field attracts a movable armature, which is mechanically linked to the relay’s contacts.</p>
        <h3>Signal Isolation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="sized">They create a separation between the input and output circuits, preventing direct electrical connections and potential damage. </li>
            <li class="sized">Signal isolation in a relay refers to the separation between the control circuit (low voltage, low current) and the load circuit (high voltage, high current).</li>
            <li class="sized">Since the coil and contacts are electrically isolated, any high voltage or current spikes from the load circuit cannot flow back into the control circuit.</li>
        </ul>  
        <strong>Key Components:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li class="sized"><h3>Coil:</h3> The input circuit, when energized, creates a magnetic field that attracts an armature.The coil is one of the key components of a relay, and it plays the central role in its operation. It is essentially a length of insulated copper wire wound into a cylindrical or rectangular shape.</li>
            <li class="sized"><h3>Armature:</h3> A movable piece of metal that is pulled by the magnetic field, causing the switch contacts to close or open.The armature in a relay is a movable iron or steel piece that plays a crucial role in the switching action. It is positioned close to the coil and is held in place by a spring when the relay is not energized.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>How it Works:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li class="sized">A small electrical signal is applied to the relay's coil.</li>
            <li class="sized">The coil becomes an electromagnet, generating a magnetic field.</li>
            <li class="sized">This magnetic field attracts the armature, causing it to move.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong >Types of Relays:-</strong>

        <strong id="img4">1.Electromagnetic Relay(EMR):</strong>
        <div class="image">
            <div class="imaged">
                <img src="../Assests/rela emr 1.jpg" alt="emr" width="290" height="290">
            </div>
        <ul>
           <li class="sized">When a small current flows through the coil, it generates a magnetic field that magnetizes the core. This magnetic force attracts the armature, causing the contacts to change position—either closing a normally open contact or opening a normally closed contact.</li>
           <li class="sized">When the current is removed, the magnetic field disappears, and the spring returns the armature and contacts to their original state.</li>
           <li class="sized">Electromagnetic relays are widely used for controlling high-power devices with low-power signals, providing isolation between control and load circuits, and ensuring safety in electrical systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong id="img5">2.AC-Directional-Relay:</strong>
        <div class="imaged">
                <img src="../Assests/ac directional relay2.webp" alt="ac directional" width="290" height="290">
            </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="sized">It typically consists of two essential elements: a measuring element (current coil) and a polarizing element (voltage coil). The relay operates only when the current exceeds a set value and its direction matches the relay’s preset characteristic.</li>
            <li class="sized">Directional relays are widely used in transmission lines, distribution networks, and interconnected power systems where current can flow in multiple directions. By ensuring that the relay trips only for faults in the specified direction, they provide selectivity, stability, and coordination in complex networks.</li>
            <li class="sized">In short, directional relays enhance protection by preventing unnecessary tripping and ensuring faults are isolated only in the correct section of the system.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong id="img6">3.Microprocessor-Relay:</strong>
        <div class="imaged">
                <img src="../Assests/microprocessor-relay.webp 23.webp" alt="microprocessor" width="290" height="290">
            </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="sized">A microprocessor relay is a modern protective relay that uses a microprocessor (a small computer chip) to monitor, analyze, and control electrical power system parameters. </li>
            <li class="sized">They measure electrical quantities such as voltage, current, frequency, and power through sensors, then compare the values with preset settings stored in memory.</li>
            <li class="sized">Additionally, they include features like self-diagnostics, event recording, communication interfaces, and remote monitoring, making them highly suitable for modern smart grids and industrial automation systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong id="img7">4.Static-Relay:</strong>
        <div class="imaged">
                <img src="../Assests/static-relay.jpg 32.jpg" alt="static" width="290" height="290">
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li class="sized">Instead, the input signal (voltage or current) is converted into a low-level DC signal, which is then processed by electronic circuits to determine if a fault or abnormal condition has occurred. If the set condition is met, the relay produces a trip output that activates the circuit breaker.</li>
                <li class="sized">Static relays are faster, more sensitive, and more reliable compared to electromagnetic relays because they have no moving mechanical parts that can wear out. They can also provide a higher degree of accuracy and flexibility in protection functions.</li>
                <li class="sized">However, they may be more vulnerable to electrical noise and require a stable auxiliary power supply. These relays are widely used in power system protection, industrial applications, and automation systems as an intermediate step between traditional electromagnetic relays and modern microprocessor-based relays.</li>
            </ul>
        <strong id="img8">5.Solid-State Relay(SSR):</strong>
        <div class="imaged">
                <img src="../Assests/solid state relay.webp 34.jpg" alt="emr" width="290" height="290">
            </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="sized">Because there are no mechanical contacts, SSRs operate silently, faster, and with a much longer lifespan compared to traditional relays. They also provide excellent electrical isolation between the control and load circuits, often using optical coupling.</li>
            <li class="sized">SSRs are commonly used in applications where frequent switching is required, such as in industrial automation, motor controls, temperature controllers, and home appliances.</li>
            <li class="sized">However, SSRs may generate heat at higher loads and require heat sinks, and they can be more expensive than electromagnetic relays. Still, their advantages in speed, reliability, and durability make them ideal for modern electronic control systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong id="img9">6.Relay-Module:</strong>
        <div class="imaged">
                <img src="../Assests/relay module.jpg 23.webp" alt="emr" width="290" height="290">
            </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="sized">A relay module is an electrically operated switch that allows low-power devices like microcontrollers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.) to control high-voltage or high-current appliances safely.</li>
            <li class="sized">It works by using a small input signal to energize an internal coil, creating a magnetic field that moves a switch and connects or disconnects the circuit.It works as an electrically operated switch, using a small input signal to open or close a much larger circuit. </li>
            <li class="sized">Relay modules usually have terminals labeled COM (Common), NO (Normally Open), and NC (Normally Closed), along with driver circuitry or an optocoupler for protection.Relay modules are commonly used in home automation, industrial control systems, and robotics to manage devices like lights, fans, and motors. </li>
